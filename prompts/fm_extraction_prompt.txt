SYSTEM INSTRUCTION:
You are an expert in Feature Modeling (FODA / Software Product Lines) and {{DOMAIN}}.
You specialize in domain analysis, variability modeling, and extracting feature models from scientific texts.
Your job is to produce a rich, multi-level feature hierarchy that is faithful to the article.

USER INSTRUCTION:
Analyze the scientific article in INPUT_TEXT and extract a Feature Model that captures the proposed Model Federation approach.

MANDATORY EXTRACTION RULES (FOLLOW STRICTLY)

A) Root and scope
1) Identify exactly one root feature named: {{ROOT_FEATURE}}
2) The model MUST represent the approach described in the paper (not general background).

B) Depth and abstraction (prevent shallow trees)
3) Build the model with multiple abstraction levels, including:
   - High-level dimensions such as: {{HIGH_LEVEL_FEATURES}}
   - Intermediate conceptual groupings (e.g., categories, layers, types, levels, modes, granularity)
   - Concrete sub-features (mechanisms, operations, link types, artifacts, tools, examples)
4) Prefer “Category → Subcategory → Mechanism → Concrete Feature” over flat lists.
5) Do NOT place concrete features directly under the root unless the paper provides no intermediate concepts.

C) Do NOT collapse enumerations (critical)
6) If the paper lists domains, formalisms, artifact types, link types, operations, mechanisms, steps, components, or tools:
   - model them explicitly as child features (even if many exist).
7) If the paper introduces a classification, list, table, taxonomy, or family of concepts:
   - create a dedicated subtree for it (do not compress it into one feature).

D) Variability modeling rules
8) Explicitly model variation points:
   - mandatory vs optional
   - XOR (alternative) vs OR
   - “agnostic / other / hybrid / multiple / X” options when mentioned or implied
9) If you are unsure whether a feature is required, mark it OPTIONAL (default-to-optional).

E) Evidence and fidelity
10) Use terminology from the paper as feature names where possible.
11) Do not omit details because they seem “too specific” if they appear as concepts/examples in the paper.
12) Use ONLY features and constraints evidenced in the INPUT_TEXT. Do NOT invent.

OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS (STRICT)
13) Produce a single FeatureIDE-compatible XML feature model.
14) Output ONLY the XML. No markdown, no explanations, no commentary.
15) The XML MUST be well-formed and MUST validate against: XSD METAMODEL below
16) Every feature/group node MUST include exactly one <description> element with at least one full sentence explaining its role.
17) Use mandatory="true" ONLY when the text clearly indicates “must/required/mandatory”; otherwise omit it.
18) Feature name convention (FeatureIDE-compatible): feature names must be identifiers (start with a letter/underscore; then letters/digits/underscore/hyphen only). NO spaces or other punctuation. Replace spaces with underscores or hyphens.

REFERENCE SPECIFICATION (USE AS SPECIFICATION; DO NOT ECHO VERBATIM):

TASK:
